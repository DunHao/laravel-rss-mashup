# RSS Mashup Widget

Hey thanks for taking on our programming challenge. Out of respect for your time, please work for 1-2 hours, but don't stress too hard. This is not a timed challenge, feel free to spend as little or as much time as you desire. I don’t expect you to finish this challenge (unless you really want to); it’s more to get a sense of your approach to programming. The people who get hired tend to show their *best* and *most elegant* work rather than their quickest or most feature-complete work.

## Objective

Write an application that shows an RSS mashup from feeds defined in a YML file.

## Instructions

* Fork and clone this repo. It contains a Laravel 5.4 default installation.
* Implement an RSS consumer widget that can be embedded in an `IFRAME` (http://example.com/widget) that will display the 10 most recent RSS feeds defined in the YML config file.
* Use a mobile-first design strategy
* Send a pull request to me ***along with your name*** when you're done or when it's been 2 hours. This step is super important; if you don't send a pull request, you definitely won't be hired.



## Bonus points (in order of WOW factor)

* Use of `composer` packages
* Use of `yarn`, `webpack`, and `es6` in the build process
* PHP7 compatibility
* Caching the RSS results for 60 minutes
